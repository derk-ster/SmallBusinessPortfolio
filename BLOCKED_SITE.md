# If vertexstudio.me is blocked as "Suspicious" (e.g. Mozo)

The site is a static portfolio and does not contain malware or phishing. Some security tools (e.g. **Mozo**) may flag new or lesser-known domains as "Suspicious" by default.

## What we did in the repo

- Added **meta description** and **canonical URL** so the site is clearly identified to crawlers and security tools.
- All external resources use **HTTPS**; there are no redirects or suspicious scripts.

## What you can do when you see the block

1. **Use "Continue anyway"**  
   On the Mozo block page, click **Continue anyway** to open the site. This is safe for vertexstudio.me.

2. **Report the wrongful block**  
   On the same page, use the link: **"If you believe this site was wrongfully blocked, please report it here"**.  
   Report **https://www.vertexstudio.me** so Mozo can whitelist it. New domains often get unblocked after review.

3. **Temporarily disable or whitelist in Mozo**  
   In the Mozo app or extension, add vertexstudio.me to allowed/trusted sites so it stops blocking it on your device.

The block is enforced by Mozo (or similar software), not by the site code. Once Mozo whitelists the domain or you use "Continue anyway", the site will load normally.
